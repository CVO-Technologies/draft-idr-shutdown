                freeform message to describe why a BGP session was shutdown.

                It has been discovered that certain BGP Path Attribute values
                have been used in BGP implementations which have been deployed
                in the wild while not being assigned by the IANA for such
                usage. This has led to deployment problems for new technologies
                such as Large BGP Communities.
            </t>
            <t>
                The squatting of values 30, 31, 129, 241, 242 and 243 has been
                confirmed by the involved vendors or through source code
                review.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">
            <t>
                Per this document, IANA is requested to assign a subcode called
                "Shutdown Message" in the "BGP Cease NOTIFICATION message
                subcodes" registry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
                Parameters" group. 
            </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
            <t>
                This document uses UTF-8 encoding for the Shutdown Message.
                There are a number of security issues with UNICODE.  Any
                implementer and operator is advised to review
                <xref target="UNICODE-TR36">UNICODE TR36</xref> (UTR36) to
                learn about these issues. This document guards against the
                technical issues outlined in UTR36 by REQUIRING "shortest form"
                encoding. However, the visual spoofing due to character
                confusion still persists.  This document tries to minimize the
                effects of visual spoofing by allowing UNICODE only where local
                script is expected and needed.
